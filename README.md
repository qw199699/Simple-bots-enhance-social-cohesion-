# The supplementary information for “Altruistic bots create new pathways to cooperation in mobile populations”

### Some evolutionary dynamic are provided here to visualize the contribution of mobile bots to cooperation within a mobile population.

The ordinary individual migrates according to the "success-driven" rule, while the bots migrate randomly with probability p (i.e., migration noise ) and with probability 1-p according to the "success-driven" rule. In these files, blue, yellow, green, and white markers indicate the cooperators, defectors, bots, and void sites, respectively. 

"SI_v1.gif" shows the evolution dynamic of the scenario without bots, in which the ordinary quickly falls into a frozen state, that is, no longer updating strategies and migrating.

"SI_v2.gif" shows that the evolution dynamic of the scenario with minor migration noise bots (p = 0.01), the introduction of mobile bots helps feed cooperation in migration and may drive cooperators to gather even after the defectors become extinct.

"SI_v3.gif" shows that the evolution dynamic of the scenario with random movement bots (p = 1), the bots can spread cooperation faster.

"SI_v4.gif" shows the result without bots when considering the slight behavioral noise (q = 0.0001) of ordinary individuals. Behavioral noise means that ordinary individuals not only randomly reset their strategies with probability q, but also randomly migrate with q probability.

"SI_v5.gif" shows that the result with minor migration noise bots (p = 0.01) when considering the slight behavioral noise (q = 0.0001) of ordinary individuals.
